# Neighborhood Map

#### About the Project
* The purpose of this project is to make a map of a neighborhood, showing Favorite Places
* It teaches us the use of multiple APIs together
* Keeping that in mind, I have using Google Map and HERE's explore API to show top 20 nearby places.
* The map is dynamic and uses the browser's geolocation to show the user top places near them.
* Clicking on any location shows the Address as well as average Rating.

#### APIs and Frameworks Used

* jQuery
* Materialize CSS for the UI design
* Google Maps Web API
* HERE Maps Explore API

#### How to run
