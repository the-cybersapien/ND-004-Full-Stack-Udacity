# Movie Website using Python

The Movie website project is my first project for the Full Stack web Developer nanodegree by Udacity. I have used YTS.ag's API to get movie details as this was the only API with a summary as well as a youtube link to the trailer.

### How to start
1. Make sure you have python 2.7 on your computer
2. Open `entertainment_center.py` using python with the following command:
`python entertainment_center.py`
3. A web page will be generated and opened in your browser

##### Note
* Some countries (and institutes) have placed a ban on YTS.ag, this may result in the API not working and the script throwing an error.
* To overcome this, please use a proxy provider, such as Psiphon.
* In case this issue is unacceptable, please tell me so I can submit the project either with a different API or by hardcoding the values inside the project itself.
